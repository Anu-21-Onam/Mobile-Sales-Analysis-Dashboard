# Mobile-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
The Mobile Sales Analysis project is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to provide a complete view of mobile phone sales performance across different demographics, brands, and regions. It combines data visualization and business intelligence to support strategic decision-making in the mobile retail sector.

  # ✨ Why This Project Stands Out
Interactive Filtering: Dynamic filters by Age, Brand, Year, and Payment Method allow user-centric analysis.<br />
Clean UI/UX: The layout uses clear visual hierarchy, iconography, and modern design patterns.<br />
Diverse Data Representation: Combines bar charts, donut charts, time-series plots, and geographic maps.<br />
Actionable Intelligence: Helps identify top-performing products, optimal selling times, and valuable demographics.<br />
